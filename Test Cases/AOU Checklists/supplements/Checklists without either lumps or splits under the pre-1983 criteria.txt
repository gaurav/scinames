Checklists without either lumps or splits under the pre-1983 criteria

 - 1886 
	- first checklist, nothing to lump or split!
 - 1894 
	- additions and deletions, but no evidence of lumps and splits.
 - 1899 
	- additions and deletions, but no evidence of lumps and splits.
 - 1909 
	- lots of higher taxonomic changes, but no evidence of lumps and splits.
 - 1912 
	- some additions and deletions, no evidence of lumps and splits.
 - 1920 
	- lots of genus and species renames, but no evidence of lumps and splits.
 - 1953 
	- not many changes, mostly involving subspecies.
	- one set of changes may be a lump, but it's not clear, so I'm going with Avibase that treats it as a rename.
 - 1957 
	- major release, so we're relying on AOU information here.
 - 1982 
	- aou_5_34 -- list of recognised species, so no information on changes
 - 1983 
	- there are lumps and splits here, so probably caused by the pre-1982 filtering
 - 1991 
	- there are lumps and splits here, so probably caused by the pre-1982 filtering
 - 1998 
	- there are lumps and splits here, so probably caused by the pre-1982 filtering	
 - 2009
	- there are lumps and splits here, so probably caused by the pre-1982 filtering
