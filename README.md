# SciNames

SciNames is a tool for analysing sets of taxonomic checklists to calculate and annotate the changes that have taken place between them. It currently stores the list of changes in a custom XML format.

A description of this tool is available in chapter 4 of my [Ph.D. dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/N2KH5).

It is available for reuse under the [GNU General Public License 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).
